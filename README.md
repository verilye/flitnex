My interpretation of the netflix formula, made manifest

This is an attempt at recreating and potentially improving on the front end design aspect of Netflix,
along with mocking a simpler version of Netflix's backend services. Ideally this completely scaled down 
version of Netflix will have a full CI/CD pipeline, showcase my skills in being able to pull off industry
grade design patterns and architecture and functionally be able to retrieve, preview and display 
small video files.
